# Wheatley

This repository contains the source code for the Wheatley bot, made for the Together C & C++ discord server.

This bot is primary internal moderation and administrative tools, such as tracking server suggestions and addressing
bot raids and scammers. Scams and bot raids usually are not targeted, but the exact techniques and heuristics used to
identify raids are, at least for now, omitted from the public mirror for this repository.
